  ## Installation
  
    Create a copy by cloning the repo locally, then open up the terminal, traverse to the repo's root directory, and log into the mysql shell . In the mysql interface, run "source ./db/schema.sql" and,. Run an npm install and then you can also run "npm run seeds" if you would like to test using the provided seeds.
  
  ## Usage
  
  As this only provides a server and a db schema, to test the endpoints one would have to use something like insomnia.  Below is a demo video showing all endpoints and CRUD operations.
